PolyK.js is JavaScript tool for working with polygons. It uses several basic principles to be super simple and super universal:

* **No classes.**<br>PolyK.js does not have any classes or special data structures. PolyK consists of static functions only.
* **What is polygon?**<br>For PolyK, polygon is an array of numbers. Each two of them are X and Y coordinate of polygon vertex.
* **Simplicity and speed.**<br>Since PolyK.js does not make you use any special data structures, it is very easy to implement into your project. Since all JS engines are optimised for work with arrays, PolyK runs very fast.

PolyK was used in the game [Tiny Monsters](http://tinymonsters.ivank.net/).
